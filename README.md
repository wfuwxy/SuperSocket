# SuperSocket  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kerryjiang/SuperSocket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kerryjiang/SuperSocket)

## This branch is under developing and unstable. If you want a stable version which can be used in your production system, please switch to branch v1.6. ##

**SuperSocket** is a light weight extensible socket application framework.
You can use it to build a server side socket application easily without thinking about how to use socket, how to maintain the socket connections and how socket works.

It is a pure C# project which is designed to be extended, so it is easy to be integrated to your existing system.
As long as your systems (like forum/CRM/MIS/HRM/ERP) are developed in .NET language,
you must be able to use SuperSocket to build your socket application as a part of your current system perfectly.
